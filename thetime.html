                The Mycenaean civilization developed. It represents the first advanced civilization of continental Greece with its palatial states, 
                urban organization, works of art and writing system. Among the centres of power that emerged were Pylos, Troy, Tyrinth and Midea in 
                the Peloponnese; Orcomenon, Thebes and Athens in Central Greece and Yolco in Thessaly. However, the most interesting city was Mycenae, 
                located in the Argolida, and which gives its name to all this civilization. 
                Mycene-influenced settlements have also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, Anatolia, the Mediterranean Levant, Cyprus and Italy.

                    The Phoenician alphabet is created. The Phoenician alphabet is an ancient consonant alphabet, it is technically an abyad script, and it is not a pictographic script. It was used to write Phoenician, a northern Semitic language used by the Phoenician civilization. It is classified as an abyad because it only represents consonant sounds, with the addition of matres lectionis for some vowels.

                        The power of the Etruscans, a civilization of antiquity whose geographical nucleus was Tuscany (Italy), starts to decrease. This was mainly due to the fact that it had to face almost at the same time the invasions of the Celts and the attacks of the Greeks and Carthaginians. Their final defeat by the Romans was facilitated by such confrontations and by the fact that the Etruscans never formed a solidly unified state but a kind of weak confederation of medium-sized cities.
