            Philip V, king of Macedonia, reigns in this period. He belonged to the anti-gonid dynasty. The reign of Philip V was characterized mainly by the unsuccessful struggle with the emerging power of Rome. Philip was attractive and charismatic like a young man. A brave and gallant warrior, who was inevitably compared to Alexander the Great and was called â€œthe beloved of the Helade".

                During this time lived Posidonio, a Greek stoic politician, astronomer, geographer, historian and philosopher, native of Apamea, Syria. He was hailed as the greatest polymer of his time, although none of his numerous works can be read today, since only fragments have survived. Posidonio became a citizen of Rhodes, where he took an active part in political life. His social status, in view of the positions he held, was very high, becoming the Pritano of Rhodes. He also served as ambassador in Rome between 87 and 86 B. C., at the time of Mario and Sila.

                    End of the Antonina dynasty. The first identifying characteristic of this dynasty was the election of a successor by the ruler. As bad luck did not provide heirs to Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian or Antoninus Pius, the throne passed in each case not in hereditary succession but to a man considered by the emperor as the best for the position. Badly considered after the restrictive reign of Domitian, whom his father Vespasian had associated with the throne, the principle of inheritance of the throne remained forgotten in the first five mandates. Only Marcus Aurelius will break the tradition by naming his son Comfortable, who would otherwise be one of the worst emperors of Rome.
