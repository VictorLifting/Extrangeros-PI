                Philip V, king of Macedonia, reigns in this period. He belonged to the anti-gonid dynasty. The reign of Philip V was characterized mainly by the unsuccessful struggle with the emerging power of Rome. Philip was attractive and charismatic like a young man. A brave and gallant warrior, who was inevitably compared to Alexander the Great and was called â€œthe beloved of the Helade".

                        The power of the Etruscans, a civilization of antiquity whose geographical nucleus was Tuscany (Italy), starts to decrease. This was mainly due to the fact that it had to face almost at the same time the invasions of the Celts and the attacks of the Greeks and Carthaginians. Their final defeat by the Romans was facilitated by such confrontations and by the fact that the Etruscans never formed a solidly unified state but a kind of weak confederation of medium-sized cities.
