            The reign of Marco Coceyo Nerva over the Roman Empire ends. Nerva was a first-century Roman politician who ruled the Empire since 96 until his death in 98. Upon accession to the throne he was sixty-six years old and a renowned senator who had dedicated his life to the service of the Empire during the reigns of Nero, Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. Under Nero was a member of the imperial retinue and played an important role in the discovery of a conspiracy against the emperor orchestrated by Senator Gaius Calpurnius Pison.

                Battle of Mount Badon. Battle in which the British-Roman forces defeated an Anglo-Saxon incursion from the north. The development of the battle is not very detailed, but is known thanks to De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, a historical sermon written by the monk Gildas in the sixth century. Gildas does not specify the names of the protagonists of the battle, nor the place. The battle is also recounted in a ninth-century text of unknown origin and author, Historia Brittonum, which partly attributes victory to the legendary King Arthur.

                    Shāhnāmé, The Book of the Kings or The Epic of the Kings, is a great poetic work written by the Persian poet Ferdousí, and is the national epic of the Persian-speaking world. The Shāhnāmeh tells the history and mythology of Iran from the creation of the world to the conquest of Iran by Islamic forces in the seventh century. In addition to its literary importance, Shâhnameh, which was written in Persian, has been key to reviving the Persian language after the influence exerted by Arabic. This voluminous work is considered by speakers of Persian as a masterpiece of literature, which also collects the history of Iran, its cultural values, its ancestral religions, and a deep sense of homeland.
