               <h3> Period:</h3><h4>Ilama (1500 BC – 100 BC)</h4>

               <h3>From:</h3> <h4> Restrepo, Valle del Cauca</h4>

               <h3>Made of:</h3>  <h4>ceramic</h4>

               <h3>Technique:</h3>  <h4>Modeling and incisions. For making the details in the fresh mud, branches of trees were used
                and when they already had all the details of the piece, it was passed to be burned in the fire to give
                the final result of the vessel.</h4>


                <h3>Use:</h3> <h4>this vessel was used in rituals and ceremonies. They were also used to carry cotton, corn,
                    medicinal plants, etc. that they were going to exchange with other communities.</h4>

                <h5>Ceramic vessels highlight the relations between human beings and nature, the everyday world and the
                    supernatural. The physical appearance of people, their hairstyles and ornaments, their daily functions
                    and activities, can be seen in these ceramic vessels in the form of men carrying containers or women
                    breastfeeding their children. <br></br>
    
                    It is known that these vessels were deposited in tombs as part of the funerary trousseau, which is why
                    it is possible that the personage that shows the vessel is the deceased himself, that is, men and women
                    dedicated to different economic, political and religious activities.<br></br>
    
                    The male figures carry a container on their backs; they show headdresses, necklaces, bracelets and body
                    painting on the chest with designs formed by geometric figures. Their facial features are exaggerated,
                    the lips thick, the nose large and aquiline and in some cases the upper and lower extremities are robust
                    and bulky, which gives them a strong and corpulent appearance. Some headdresses are ridge-shaped and
                    parallel incised lines can be seen on the head, resembling a hairstyle. On the other hand, the feminine
                    figures, of robust context, also exhibit corporal adornments, hairstyles and necklaces. In these the
                    theme of motherhood is recurrent.</h5>
